# Twitter AdSense and the Follow layer of the web

Twitter's numbers aren't good. They only have 54M users in the US, 241M worldwide and it's not growing much. Wall Street sanctioned that and $TWTR stock plunged by more than 20% after their first earnings call.

Twitter has been struggling from the very beginning to attract the masses on their network. Instead of fighting this reality, they should embrace it. 

Twitter at its core is a real time distribution system of containers with a 140 characters header. Their job is to build the follower/following network and efficiently distribute those containers through this graph. Their monetization should be about helping advertisers build up their following and help them get their containers in the timelines of the right people to maximize engagement.

Therefore, their most important metric is the number of timeline views, engagement and average CPM/CPA. Where those timelines are being seen doesn't matter much. Could be Twitter.com, their mobile app, a weekly email digest, or on a publisher site through widgets.

That's why they should offer a "Who to follow" widget for publishers. Something that you could add to your site and that, based on the content of the page, would automatically suggest people to follow. One of which could be of course a sponsored one and publishers would get a cut.

That will give Twitter a much larger inventory to monetize but it will also give them more visibility to capture new users who want to follow brands, experts and celebrities. They could be the Follow layer of the web.

It's about the flow baby, not the destination.
